## Message Notification Router

Build an AI-powered system for WhatsApp that decides which messages deserve immediate attention, which should wait, and which should be muted.

The system must reason over multimodal messages, including text messages, image posters/screenshots, and voice notes.

WhatsApp is noisy. A user can receive family chats, society notices, school updates, co-worker messages, business account promotions, image posters, voice notes, and scams in the same message stream. Treating every message the same creates two bad outcomes: important messages get missed, and unwanted or risky messages interrupt the user.

## Suggested Workflow

1. Inspect `dataset/sample_messages.csv` to understand the expected output format.
2. Load `dataset/messages.csv` and all relevant context files.
3. Build your routing system using any approach: LLMs, retrieval, rules, classifiers, agents, or hybrids.
4. Write predictions to `output.csv`.
5. Evaluate your approach on the solved sample rows before submitting.

You may use any language or runtime. Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript are all reasonable choices.

## Requirements

Your solution must:

- be runnable from the terminal
- read the provided files from `dataset/`
- produce a valid `output.csv`
- include one prediction for every `message_id` in `dataset/messages.csv`
- not use organizer-only files or hardcoded labels

If you use API keys or secrets, read them from environment variables. Never hardcode secrets in the repo.
